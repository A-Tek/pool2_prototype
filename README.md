# [A-TEK Inc Prototype](http://52.5.25.227/)


##**1. Summary**
A-TEK is extremely pleased to submit a proposal for the GSA Agile Services contract. We understand the detailed requirements of the IDIQ contractor. We possess the proven methodology and technology experience to support F18Ã­s vision for executing the IDIQ and task orders. The following sections describe our Agile Approach and Technical Approach for the prototype.   
  
##**2. Prototype Methodology**


#####**2.1 Scrum Agile Approach**

Applying the Scrum Agile methodology, we designed, developed, and tested the agileTek prototype; allowing us to highlight our agile capabilities and process maturities. The following information defines the high-level Scrum methodology utilized for this prototype.

  We assigned a Product Manager, Agile Coach, Scrum Master, UI Experts, and Developers to design, develop, and test the prototype. The Product Manager role defines the requirements, maintains and prioritizes the backlog, and approves the sprint cycles and prototype suggestions. 
We executed two sprints with a sprint duration of one week. As part of the first sprint, we included user stories, related user interface design, and technology selection. The second sprint included developing and delivering the prototype. Per our methodology guidelines, we conducted 15-minute daily-standup meetings and at the end of each sprint retrospectives. We delivered a total of 550 points for two sprints compared to the planned 600 points. Our approach included assigning external user roles to provide feedback on the prototype after each sprint. 


#####**2.2 Continuous Development and Integration Process**
A-TEK understands the importance of continuous development for iterative delivery approaches. We applied the following setup for continuous integration of the prototype. We used Docker, Jenkins, and Github open-source technologies for the setup. We deployed the setup on Amazon EC2 VPC with CloudWatch as the monitoring agent. We adopted Mocha.js to write the unit test cases for our client controller classes. Refer to our source code repository for unit test scripts. The following information details our CD/CI approach for this prototype.

##**3.	Technical Architecture**


After reviewing the IDIQ requirements and open-source requirements, A-TEK selected node.js-based, open-source Mean stack framework for this prototype. This framework is JSON standards based, flexible, and supported on no-sql mongo database as the backend repository. Our prototype is deployed on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Amazon EC2 on ubuntu platform with EC2 Cloudwatch and PM2 process manager for node.js as monitoring and statistics services. 

The following provides some of the benefits of our selected tools:

* Use of end-to-end complete, open-source java script stack
* Fast, easy, and standards-based setup and development
* Support for modern browsers and responsive design to support multiple devices
* Flexible document-based, no-sql-based database


The following information details the high-level technical architecture of the Mean stack used for the prototype.

##**3. Benefits and Retrospective**
**The following provides some of the benefits of our prototype approach:**

* We were able to demonstrate our agile capabilities along with technical capabilities, while adopting continuous integration with unit tests; which helped us identify defects early and reduce time spent fixing dependency errors.
* Our Agile approach included a user experience design, which helped us to create a UI design, reviewed and developed quickly
* We proved our git and open-source capabilities with our tools and technology selection


**The following defines some areas of improvement for our prototype approach:**

* We would have demonstrated our User Experience and Technology experience with more days allocated 
* Due to the schedule restriction, we only executed one sprint for the prototype

##**4. Installation Instructions**

### Prerequisites:

**Node.js** - Download & Install Node.js and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this GitHub Gist to install Node.js

**MongoDB** - Download & Install MongoDB, and make sure it's running on the default port (27017)

**Bower** - You're going to use the Bower Package Manager to manage your front-end packages. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install bower globally using npm
